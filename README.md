### Description
A (work-in-progress) physics simulation to show why the Moon doesn't crash into Earth.

##### TODO
* Add velocity to ball and game steps where position & whatnot is updated. Result: if u give Moon a starting velocity, it should move!
* Gravitational acceleration.
* Collision detection (normal force).
* Friction.
* Ability to fire Moon out of cannon.
* Aesthetic: background stars; land on Earth; craters on moon; stars move across sky; ...
